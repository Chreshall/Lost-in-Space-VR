Description:
It’s a VR app of a spaceship. It’s like a ship from the Netflix show “Lost in space”.
So user will be able to roam around the space ship and interact with stuff inside.
I also added a few Easter eggs of the show, like the original script material, name tags and rocks like the seen in the show. There are 4 main rooms in total, all connected by a interconnected bridge
We start from the main engine control room. The user is woken up by a loud alarm. They need to go towards the sound and disable it first.
Then they get to roam around the room where they get a basic idea of where they are.
The user can unlock other rooms and explore the different cabinets in the spaceship. Make food, Go to Washroom or just open crates. The emotion that was tried to capture was loneliness as the title suggests Lost in Space. 

Archivements:

In fundamentals:
1.	Scale achievement (100 points):
Correctly use scale to make the user feel small or large relative to another object. If the user is supposed to be a giant, then the user should feel tall. If the user is supposed to be an ant, they should feel small. Or if they should feel about human height, then use another object to communicate a sense of scale disparity.
2. Animation achievement (100 points)
	Create an animation, either via scripting to bring your scene to life.
	3. Lighting achievement (100 points)
	Use a mix of baked and real-time lighting to add realistic shading to each scene.
	4. Locomotion achievement (100 points)
	Create a locomotion system that is appropriate to your experience. 
	5. Physics achievement (100 points)
	Simulate Physics forces in your experience. For example, depending on your experience, you may want to simulate gravity.
6. Empathy achievement (100 points)
	Design an experience that helps others empathize with a different point of view. In this app it’s the loneliness of the astronaut.
In completeness:
1.  Diegetic UI achievement (250 points)
Instead of adding a lot of text to your scenes, represent interface elements naturally so users intuitively find things for themselves. They should not be told what to do, they should easily figure out how to do it.	
2. Alternative Storyline achievement (250 points)
At some point in your story / experience, give your user an option to choose between different storylines. In this app the user is left to choose the way he explores the spaceship. Sometimes they might find some secret Easter eggs otherwise it’s a space tour normally.
3.	Gamification achievement (250 points)
Make your experience fun by adding in a reward system. The true Lost in Space Series fans will get many Easter eggs related to the show.

In challenges:
1.	User Testing achievement (250 points)
(2x if you completed 750 points in Completeness)
